FEATURES
(1). 3D skeletal model :- Ek 3D skeletal visualization jo treadmill par chalti insaan ki movement dikhata hai; major joint
motion capture markers (hip, knee, ankle, shoulder) aur digital overlays se stride length, joint angles, aur gait cycle
phases highlight kiye gaye hain.
(2) . Future prediction -. Future prediction in gait analysis refers to using current and past gait data to estimate or
forecast a person's upcoming movement patterns, walking ability, or recovery outcomes
(3). Voice coach= It is a real-time auditory feedback system that uses spoken cues, alerts, or sounds to guide a person's
walking pattern during gait training.
(4). Instant correction = Instant correction means giving real-time feedback to the patient while walking so they can
immediately adjust their gait (instead of waiting for later review).
(5). Future injury heat map= A Future Injury Heat Map is a visual predictive tool that shows which parts of the body
(joints or muscles) are at higher risk of injury based on gait analysis data.
(6). Corrective feedback= Corrective feedback means giving specific instructions or cues (voice, visual, or haptic) to
help a person change their walking pattern during gait training.It focuses on what is wrong and how to fix it.
(7).gait health score = A Gait Health Score is a numerical value or rating system used to measure walking ability,
balance, and stability.It helps physiotherapists or doctors quantify gait performance and track improvement. One of
the most widely used clinical tools is the Berg Balance Scale (BBS).
(7). Gamification= Gamification means using game-like elements (points, levels, challenges, avatars, rewards) in rehab
or gait training to make the process engaging, motivating, and fun for patients.
(8). Dashboard= A dashboard is a visual interface that displays all relevant gait data, progress, and analytics in one
place for clinicians, therapists, or patients. It turns complex sensor/motion capture data into easy-to-read charts,
graphs, and metrics
