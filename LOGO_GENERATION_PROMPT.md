## Main Prompt:

```
Create a minimalist, modern app icon and logo for a mobile health and fitness app called "Kadam" (which means "step" in Hindi). 

**App Concept:**
Kadam is a gait analysis and walking health app that uses AI and computer vision to analyze users' walking patterns, detect potential injury risks, and provide personalized health insights through real-time pose detection.

**Design Requirements:**

1. **Style & Aesthetic:**
   - Minimalist, Gen Z-friendly design
   - Clean, modern, and sleek
   - Should feel premium and health-focused
   - Geometric or abstract representation (not photorealistic)
   - Suitable for both dark and light backgrounds

2. **Color Palette:**
   - Primary: Indigo/Purple gradient (#6366F1 to #8B5CF6) - the app's main brand color
   - Accent: Vibrant green (#22C55E) for health/wellness
   - Background: Dark (#0B0B0F) or light depending on usage
   - Keep it to 2-3 colors max for icon simplicity

3. **Core Elements to Incorporate:**
   - A stylized footprint, step, or walking motion
   - Could combine: footstep icon + health/wellness symbol
   - Abstract representation of movement, progress, or stride
   - Should convey: walking, steps, movement, health monitoring, technology

4. **Icon Variations Needed:**
   - Square app icon (1024x1024px) with rounded corners preview
   - Horizontal logo for splash screen (1920x1080px safe area)
   - Vertical logo variant for headers
   - Consider a wordmark "Kadam" text treatment

5. **Style References:**
   - Similar to fitness apps like Strava, Nike Run Club, or Apple Health - but more minimalist
   - Tech-forward feel like Notion or Linear icons
   - Health-focused like Calm or Headspace branding

6. **Technical Considerations:**
   - Must be recognizable at small sizes (16px - 512px)
   - Works in monochrome (single color) versions
   - Clear silhouette/outline
   - No fine details that would be lost at small sizes

7. **Concept Ideas (pick one or combine):**
   - Option A: Stylized footprint with a digital/tech overlay (circuit lines, grid pattern)
   - Option B: Abstract walking path/dotted line forming a "K" or step pattern
   - Option C: Minimalist human figure in walking pose with health pulse line
   - Option D: Step counter/graph visualization with a footprint icon
   - Option E: Geometric shapes forming steps/stairs leading upward

**Deliverables:**
1. App icon (square, centered logo, transparent or gradient background)
2. Splash screen logo (centered, with "Kadam" wordmark and tagline: "Your step to better health")
3. Simplified monochrome version for dark mode headers

**Additional Context:**
- The app has a dark theme with neon purple/indigo accents
- Target audience: Health-conscious individuals, athletes, physical therapy patients
- Brand personality: Modern, approachable, tech-savvy, health-focused

## Tips for Using with Image Generators:

1. **ChatGPT/DALL-E:** Use the full detailed prompt above
2. **Midjourney:** Use shorter version with style parameters like `--style raw --ar 1:1` for icon
3. **Stable Diffusion:** Add technical terms like "app icon", "UI design", "flat design", "vector style"
4. **Multiple Iterations:** Generate several variations and ask for:
   - Different color treatments
   - Alternative icon concepts
   - Text logo variants
   - Icon with/without background

## Post-Generation Checklist:

After generating, you may need to:
- [ ] Adjust colors to match exact brand colors (#6366F1, #8B5CF6)

- [ ] Generate splash screen variants for different screen sizes
- [ ] Export in multiple formats (PNG, SVG for scalability)
- [ ] Create favicon versions (16x16, 32x32, etc.)
